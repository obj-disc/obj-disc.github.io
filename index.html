            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

            <p>This year, in accordance with Visual Perception via Learning in an Open World (VPLOW) workshop, we
                firstly organize Foundational Model without Descriptive Caption (FMDC) challenge in CVPR 2023. This
                year’s FMDC challenge proposes a zero-shot/few-shot image classification problem leveraging FMs (i.e.,
                CLIP, CoCa), to deal with novel samples in the real world. From an industry perspective, when novel
                samples occur in the business, we may retrieve and annotate every novel sample to re-train the model.
                However, it becomes too expensive if we perform this procedure whenever novel samples occur. To this
                end, utilizing the zero-shot/few-shot classification ability of recently-proposed foundational models
                can be a reasonable &amp; presumable solution. Therefore, we hereby aim to empower candidate workshop
                participants to contemplate this challenge and let the students, researchers, and Machine Learning
                community access the industry-level dataset retrieved in the real world.</p>

            <p>The FMDC Challenge 2023 is hosted by SOCAR. SOCAR is the largest car-sharing platform in Repbulic of
                Korea, providing a seamless mobility experience from car, public transportations, parking lots, electric
                bike, and even autonomous vehicles. The organizers are applied research scientists at SOCAR, and
                currently researching/developing on AI products for the business impact in the real world.</p>

                Zero/Few-shot Image Classification with Foundational Models</h2>

            <p>In this year’s FMDC challenge, we propose a business problem called car state classification in the open
                world. A car state classification aims to recognize a car’s various statuses (i.e., exterior damage,
                dirt, wash, etc.) that occur in the real world, especially in SOCAR, the largest car-sharing platform in
                the Republic of Korea. The SOCAR requires its users to take pictures of cars before they drive, to
                monitor the car’s status. Based on these images, SOCAR establishes an image classifier that identifies
                the car’s various statuses and performs follow-up business actions for efficient business operation
                (i.e., washing the car if ‘exterior dirt’ is detected, sending the car if harsh damage is detected). The
                most challenging part of managing this classifier is dealing with novel samples occurring in the real
                world. For example, how can we identify novel patterns of dirty cars? How can we recognize novel damage
                patterns such as harsh car breakage or accident? To resolve these challenges, leveraging FM’s
                effectiveness, we propose the real-world car image dataset and empower the participants to solve this
                problem. When we use (i.e., fine-tune) FMs in industry, one of the challenging hurdles is the lack of
                descriptive caption. While web-crawled large-scale datasets such as <a
                    href="'https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/'">LAION-5B</a> have affluent captions on each image,
                real-world images usually have class-level or even weakly-labeled annotations. Then, how can we
                effectively fine-tune or transfer the inductive bias at the FMs into the particular domain? This will be
                a primary starting point for your journey to this challenge.

            <h2 id="dataset">Dataset</h2>

            <p>In this challenge, we are releasing SOCAR (Socially-Obtained CAR) dataset, which includes ten-thousand
                car images retrieved from the real world car-sharing operation. For a detailed description of the SOCAR
                dataset, please refer to the paper <a
                    href="'https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2023W/DNOW/papers/Seo_SOCAR_Socially-Obtained_CAR_Dataset_for_Image_Recognition_in_the_Wild_WACVW_2023_paper.pdf'">SOCAR:
                    Socially-Obtained CAR Dataset for Image Recognition in the Wild</a></p>

            <p>The <strong>Training Set</strong> includes 13 classes, each representing car’s status that the
                car-sharing platform can easily understand.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Exterior Normal</li>
                <li>Exterior Damage</li>
                <li>Bubble Wash</li>
                <li>Car in a Washing machine</li>
                <li>Dashboard</li>
                <li>Cupholder</li>
                <li>Glovebox</li>
                <li>Washer Fluid</li>
                <li>Front Seat</li>
                <li>Read Seat</li>
                <li>Trunk</li>
                <li>Clean Sheet</li>
                <li>Tire</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In a <strong>Support Set</strong> (which can be used under the few-shot learning setting), we provide 6
                additional classes which cannot be easily expected in the real world. However, it becomes more
                challenging in the open-world setting as the pattern of these classes is diverse and cannot be expected
                a priori.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Exterior Dirt</li>
                <li>Dirty Cupholder</li>
                <li>Dirty Sheet</li>
                <li>Dirty Seat</li>
                <li>Car on a rainy day</li>
                <li>Car on a snowy day</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In the <strong>Test Set</strong>, we provide a total of 19 classes of car status, which concatenates
                classes at both the Training and Support set.</p>
